# Problem Statement

You are the Data Analyst working with the Customer Strategies department of a global broadband internet service provider. Of late, you have received heads up from the management about the Customers churning out of the service due to multiple reasons. As part of the requirement of the management you need to classify the customers into different segments so that specific business actions can be initiated. For example, from the list of customers if you could segment the customers who are happy with our service, customers who are NOT so happy with our service, customers to whom a higher revenue plan can be sold off etc., the team can initiate targeted efforts to each of the segment of customers differently so that we stop the churning customers, retain the existing happy customer and sell a higher revenue plan to customer who probably might buy it and many other segments that would make a valid business sense.  
Note: You are free to derive your own criteria for categorizing happy customers, NOT so happy customers, customers to whom higher revenue plans can be sold off and any other customer segment you could identify using the provided variables in the dataset.
To help you chalk out the approach, we have identified a sample of 200 customers with variables namely Usage, Cost and No of Issues faced (Refer excel sheet). Use these variables to segment the customers into various segments as described above. 
Reach out to the point of contact if you need more clarification. You are free to use any tool, techniques at your disposal. There are no restrictions.
Expectation:
  1.	Understanding of the business problem.
  2.	Identify a scalable solution approach to solve the given business problem (scalable means using the approach you should be able to replicate the results for a           larger set of customers)
  3.	Techniques used to solve the given business problem.
  4.	Presentation of the findings.
